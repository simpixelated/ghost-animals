A really simple frontend + backend JavaScript application: The backend server (Express or whatever you prefer) includes a route that returns a list of animals in JSON format. The frontend app uses React. It simply places a button on the page, and when that button is clicked, the app pulls down the list of animals from the backend and renders it in a table.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Start the app:
```
npm install
npm start
```
